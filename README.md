2. Elements of Computer System Design
3. Naming schemes
4. Enforcing modularity with Clients and Services
5. Enforcing modularity with Virtulization
6. Performance
7. Fault tolerance 
8. Atomicity

The repository consists of 3 homeworks and 1 project. The design file explaining how the file system is designed is attached with all the directories.
