# Principles of Computer System Design

A broad introduction to the main principles and abstractions for engineering hardware and software systems, and in-depth studies of their use on computer systems across a variety of designs, be it an operating system, a client/server application, a database server, or a fault-tolerant disk cluster.
  
## Topics covered

1. Systems
2. Elements of Computer System Design
3. Naming schemes
4. Enforcing modularity with Clients and Services
5. Enforcing modularity with Virtulization
6. Performance
7. Fault tolerance 
8. Atomicity

## Contents

This folder consists 3 assignments and a project that I designed as part of my Principles of Computer System Design here at the University of Florida. 
1. [Flat in-memory filesystem with data stored as blocks](Assignment1)
2. [Multiple level in-memory filesystem with data stored as blocks](Assignment2)
3. [Client/Server in-memory filesystem](Assignment3)
4. [XMLRPC based fault tolerant distributed FUSE filesystem](Project)

The assignments and the project are shown here in the chronological order in which it was developed. Each assignment adds a feature to the FUSE filesystem which helps us to finally design our project which inherites all those features.
